    "* Let's create a function ```main``` with two parameters: ```year``` and ```month```.\n",

    "Hint: after refactoring, check that the code still works. Just run it e.g. for Feb 2021 and see if it finishes successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to run it, you can write results to your local filesystem. E.g. here:\n",
